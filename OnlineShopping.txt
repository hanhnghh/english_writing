Online shopping pros and cons

Nowadays, online shopping makes a revolution in how people shop. In comparison with purchasing in traditional way, it has undeniable pros and several cons also.

Firstly, the foremost benefit of online shopping is the convenience for shoppers. People can buy almost anything without ever leaving the comfort of their own home. They 
do not have to suffer huge crowds of people or tediously long queues in the high street shops. Online stores are available 24/7 and are accessible from any 
location with an Internet connection, so the concern about openning time is eliminated, purchasers can buy online anything in their available time, even at one o'clock in the morning.
With a click of a button, people can order what they want, and have it delivered directly to their front door. 

On the other hand, with online shopping, shoppers can try before they buy. This disadvantage can lead to clothes do not fit very well or are not as expecting. 
A piece of clothing might look great in photos online, but quite different in real life. It's always annoying and disappointing when a t-shirt is a little too big, or a red sweater might turn out
to be orange, or even the material of a bomber jacket will feel cheap for example. Waiting time of delivering is another downside of online purchasing. Customers have to wait days or even weeks for the item to arrive,
whereas in the case of shopping at a store, when see any interesting thing, they will pay, take and use it instantly.

Online shopping has its own advantages, seems ideal for someone with a busy lifestyle in the current bustling modern world. For other customers, they will continue to find the time for a trip to a real shop, 
where they know exactly what they are buying.
