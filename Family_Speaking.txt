1. Family

He bears a remarkable resemblance to my mother

My family always gather at dinner and discuss various types of stuff. I often take advice on important things from my parents

If I were to choose between the two, I'll go with my family. 

whereas I dont actually meet my friends very often. Although sometimes I have more fun with my friends because they are closer to my age, I still tend to prefer hanging out with my family.

Of course it is. Family is the most important thing in the world to me. It's the only thing that never turns back on me and it's really all I have in the long run.

Once I grew up and moved out and away, I more realized how important they are. I've been through some very painful times and I do not know what I would do without their love, support and strength as if they are always
be there for me.

Actually I prefer my family remains unchanged. Although I also wanna live in an extend family then family members can support and foster each other but I'm a bit worried about generation gaps, which might leads to some
unecessary arguments. And it can not be smaller coz we're already complete.

My current workout at home is a combination of 2 exercise, which each is performed every second day. 

what I enjoy most about doing excercise at home is its flexibility, you know. First, I can arrange time for exercise that fitted with my work and study timetable. It's hard to find the fixed time with my current work, 
but with these exercise, I can do whenever available. Secondly, It does not require extra equipments and easy to follow, but same demanding as other workout types. You dont need to spent a lot of money for buying 
expensive and heavy equipment. 

==========================================================

I don't have car so I usually use public transport, like trains, buses, trams. Actually back in VN, I had a motorbike by which I always commute to work but I can't afford one here.

My favorite ways to travel is by train coz it's quick, convenient, reliabe and especiall punctual. What I like most about this types of transport is that I can totally forget about traffic congestion
as therefore pollution. Plus, the rail fare is quite resonable, I mean, quite afforable for a student like me.

By plane, of course, coz it doesn't take me too long to get to my destination. It's kind of exhausted and unpleasant to me to travel by other types. Coz I don't want to wast my valueable time just getting
there while I can use that time to enjoy and do lots of more important things.

It's terribly bad. I have to say, especially in Hanoi. It becomes the last place I wanted to live because of the traffic it has. People often give themselves about an hour extra time to arrive on time due to traffic jam.
Just imagine this, Hanoi does really looks like a gian car park. And the traffic network like traffic lights, transport lane.. are all old fashioned. And accidents on the main road seem to happen everyday. People always
hope to have a better system but it appears to be day dreaming coz it's just getting worse.

the gorvernment should subsidize thieir budget to upgrade its system and quality, increasing the frequency of trains and buses, making it more reliable and punctual for the convenience of commuters, more accessible for
people with low income

We have a serious issue with pollution levels in some of our big cities. The fact that global warming is leading to severe climate change brings out many problems
Also exhaust fumes from cars and lorries are definitely another cause for this issue but we also have a lot of heavy industry in some areas and this also result 
in poor air quality. It is actually getting worse.

Although I'm kind of a city-belonging person and don't have many chances to get back to nature very often, I'm fascinated by the natural world. When I watch 
documentaries showing wild animals in their natural habitat, I feel excited.

It's hard to say for sure. I think some people are concerned but probably not enough and others are absolutely not, in my point of view. Yeah, admittedly, there 
are people who take environmental problems seriously enough to actually have environmentally friendly behaviours like recycling their rubbish, doing energy 
conservation and stuff, but almost all of our people are indifferent to environmental related issue coz they thing that's not theirs to care. We don't care 
about resource depletion, about natural disasters, man-made disasters, we don't care about any kind of pollution or conservations. We all know that the world's
resources are used at an alarming rate but no one seems to actually feel it's their responsibility to change the way they live.

I think there might be some possible reasons for that. In some cases it is simply because people are not affected on a day-to-day/daily basis so it does not 
concern them. They just saw the problems on the news affecting other people. It does not mean they dont care but they will soon forget about it. Also, some people
think, including us, you cant deny, it is a long term problem, we will be dead by the time it will affect us so we think it is not important for us right now. Live 
for the moment, not the future. 

Well, climate change is a real issue. With the even presence of deforestation and desertification, in my country we even have flash floods and heatwaves on a yearly
basis, I think global warming is the biggest issue we should care about now.

There are countries that do what they can do to help their people when problems occur and they are trying to come up with measures to mitigate the effects but
when it comes to the major issue of global warming countries are not doing enough or sometime doing it wrong. This is usually because government knows that 
to make a serious step toward this will have to sacrifice economic or political growth and they are not prepared to do this. government thinks very short term.
They know that if there is economic decline, they will be voted out but they don't know that if they do not take steps, they will be turned back by their own people.

On the one hand there are various worldwide agencies that are always the first on the scene with humanitarian aid after natural and man-made disasters and on the 
other hand we have environmental groups that are constantly raising awareness of issues and trying to stop disasters happening. However, nothing will work without
efforts from each of our own. So wake up and save yourself.
