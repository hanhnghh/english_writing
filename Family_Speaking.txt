He bears a remarkable resemblance to my mother

My family always gather at dinner and discuss various types of stuff. I often take advice on important things from my parents

If I were to choose between the two, I'll go with my family. 

whereas I dont actually meet my friends very often. Although sometimes I have more fun with my friends because they are closer to my age, I still tend to prefer hanging out with my family.

Of course it is. Family is the most important thing in the world to me. It's the only thing that never turns back on me and it's really all I have in the long run.

Once I grew up and moved out and away, I more realized how important they are. I've been through some very painful times and I do not know what I would do without their love, support and strength as if they are always
be there for me.

Actually I prefer my family remains unchanged. Although I also wanna live in an extend family then family members can support and foster each other but I'm a bit worried about generation gaps, which might leads to some
unecessary arguments. And it can not be smaller coz we're already complete.
