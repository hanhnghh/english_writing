Cause and effect of traffic congestion

Traffic congestion becomes more popular in today's society, affects people throughout the world. This essay will discuss the main reasons of
traffic jam and describe the possible effects of the problem.

According to many recent researches, the foremost causes of traffic congestion is the significant increase in the today's traffic densities, especially
in big cities. The road capacities in most cities were maxed out, reached the limit of what they can take, whereas the number of vehicles is rising
rapidly. Even when alternative ways of getting around are available, most people still prefer using their cars because they are looking for convenience,
comfort and privacy. Poor awareness of driver is another cause of congestion. 
In dense traffic, congestion can happen for no obvious reason. Sometimes, all it takes is slightly erratic driver behavior, like sudden slowing down.
The slower speed creates a sustained traffic jam. 

The first effect when it comes to traffic congestion is the delay. In the US, commuters spend an average of a full working weak each year sitting in congested
roadways. Congestions can make commuters late for work during the morning, or preventing them from getting home to relax after long tough working day, etc. 
These delays are the effects most people feel because they are universal to everyone who has to maneuver through congested roads. The consecutively stopping and starting vehicle's engine
in traffic jams burns fuel at a substantially higher rate than normal. This increase in fuel consumption costs commuters additional money for fuel and it also contributes to the amount of 
emissions released by the vehicles. These emissions create air pollution and are related to global warming.
