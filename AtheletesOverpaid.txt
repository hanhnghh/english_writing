it is said sports people earn too much money. Do you agree?

It is often argued that sports people earn too much money, hugely higher than other careers in society. Although I agree with this opinion, especially in case of professional athletes, I think that it is not ridiculous.

On the one hand, there is a fact that sports stars get paid too much money. Today sports is not merely for improving both physical and mental health, it gradually has become a real entertainment industry, with enomous profit. This 
explains why sports clubs or sports companies always pay massive money for sports stars in order to recruit or keep them stay with club, because of their professional competence and their brand value, etc. For example, the average 
footballer in the Premier League - the top level of the English football league system, gets 44.000 pound a week, or 2.3 milion pound a year. For comparision, an average full-time worker in the UK gets 22.600 pound a year. Or in NBA 
- a profesional basketball league in North America, the average wage is $6.2 milion in 2016-2017 season, what an impressive number!

On the other hand, I think athletes earn what they deserve by being the best in the game. Professional athletes are not a bunch of couch potatoes, they put their bodies through hell to deliver for audiences who pay good money for
entertaiment. Athletes put in well over 40 hours a week of practice, study, workouts, and game time. They also put their careers on the line each and every time they go to work. Moreover, the average career for most professional 
athletes is 5 years or less, if they get a serious injury. There are many cases sportperson have to retire because of injuries in training and competition, such as Brandon Roy, Jay William in basketball, Monica Seles in tennis.

To conclude, though I agree that some sports people are overpaid, I think almost profesional athletes deserve what they receive.
