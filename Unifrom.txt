High school students should wear uniforms to schools

It is often argued that high school students should wear uniforms to school. Although I agree that uniforms is an integral part of school, I think that wearing uniforms to schools has some drawbacks.

On the one hand, wearing uniforms enhances school pride, unity and community spirit. By wearing clothing representing school, students feel pride in their own school, regarding to its tradition and achivements, 
especially reputable schools. This feeling enhances their responsibility, to preserve and promote the tradition of school. A study of over 1,000 Texas middle school students found that students in uniform "reported 
significantly more positive perceptions of belonging in their school community than reported by students in the standard dress group". Another outstanding benefit from wearing uniform is keeping students focused on their 
education, not their clothes. With same outfit, they are less concerned about how they look and how they fit in with their peers, time consuming for picking and shopping clothes is reduced also, thus heightening student focus 
on schoolwork.

On the other hand, wearing uniforms restricts student's freedom of expression. Clothing choices are a crucial form of self-expression. Clothing or fashion is about expressing person's identity, standpoint, etc. Whereas, uniforms
eliminates all these expressions. Students also oppose school uniforms. They think uniforms does not help them fit it in school, also make them get uncomfortable. Some kids may find their fabric itchy, while others may find the 
zippers and buttons restrictive. Then also, some girls don’t like wearing dresses or skirts, which is what most girl’s uniforms require.

On things considered, school uniforms are not for everyone. However, the argument seems to favor the pros more, providing many advantages than disadvantages to the uniform school policy.
