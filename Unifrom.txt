High school students should wear uniforms to schools

It is often argued that high school students should wear uniforms to school. Although I agree that uniforms is an integral part of school, I think that wearing uniforms to schools has some drawbacks.

On the one hand, wearing uniforms enhances school pride, unity and community spirit. By wearing clothes representing for school, students feels proud of their own school, regarding to its tradition and achivements, 
especially famous schools. This feeling will improve their responsibility, to maintain and promote the tradition of school. Moreover, a study of over 1,000 Texas middle school students found that students in uniform "reported 
significantly more positive perceptions of belonging in their school community than reported by students in the standard dress group". Another outstanding benefit from wearing uniform is keeping students focused on their 
education, not their clothes. With same outfit, they are less concerned about how they look and how they fit in with their peers, time consuming for picking and shopping clothes is reduced also, thus heightening student focus 
on schoolwork.

On the other hand, wearing uniforms restricts student's freedom of expression. Clothing choices are a crucial form of self-expression. Clothing or fashion is about expressing person's identity, standpoint, etc. Whereas, uniforms
eliminates all these expressions.
