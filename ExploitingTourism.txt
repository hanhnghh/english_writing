tourism is becoming a good source of revenue to many countries. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of exploiting this resouces.

The travel and tourism industry is one of worlds's largest industries, and becoming a major source of revenue to many countries. There is no denying the 
fact that tourism offers many benefits, but it does not mean there are no drawbacks when it comes to exploiting this resource.

Tourism brings in money, this probably is it's main advantage. Tourism is very important for many countries, due to the income generated by providing services 
for tourism such as entertainment, accommodation and catering, and by the taxes levied on enterprises in this industry. Generally, these countries depend greatly 
upon travel expenditures, especially from foreigners. Besides, tourism provides direct employment within this industry and indirectly for the people in service industries associated with 
tourism such as hotels, restaurants, bars. 

In the down side, tourism may has negative effects on enviroment. Too many tourists cause pollution and environment damage, especially for natural wonders. For instance,
Son Doong cave, which recently discovered in Vietnam, as known as world's largest cave. The eco-system inside Son Doong cave is as unique as it large, and it even has its
own localized weather system. But now it is seriouly threatened by tourism project which build a cable car to this cave. This project may compromise the integrity and 
environment splendor of the area. Similar projects on Mount Fansipan and in Halong Bay have resulted in dramatic environmental damage.

On things considered, tourism is a very important industry in the world. It brings a big business and many employment opportunities. But in the meantime, it also has adverse 
effects on environment. As a consequence, goverments should keep the balance between the environment and tourism revenue.
