It is often argued about existance of zoos, should or should not maintain them. Both the supporters and opponents of this issue have their own rational reasons.

On the one hand, the zoo provides the community, especially children an accessible approach to animals. By bringing people and animals together, people has chance of observing the habit
and unique instinct of, for instance, wild animals such as a lions, crocodiles or even popular ones as birds, goats, cows, which become rare in today modern society. This exposure and 
education motivate people to protect the animals. Also, zoos help saving endangered species. In the wild, because of their benefits, human attempt hunting to extinction despite the ban from 
the gorvernment. In zoos, animals are protected from poachers, habitat loss, starvation, and predators.

On the other hand, for animals, the zoo can not replace the natural environment. Animals in captivity suffer from stress, boredom due to the narrowness of cages. This gradually leads to their health
issues in term of physical and mental. Particularly, animals might even be cruelly mistreated in some zoos. 

On things considered, the role of zoos is undeniably indispensable. But it would be perfect if human can overcome all its drawbacks.
